🚀 Project: Fetch Users from Public API → Transform → Save as CSV

This project is a simple end-to-end ETL pipeline where we:

Fetch user data from a public API

Convert the JSON response into a DataFrame

Flatten nested fields (address, company)

Select meaningful columns

Save the final clean output into a CSV file

This is a great beginner-friendly project to practice working with APIs, Pandas, and basic data engineering patterns.
